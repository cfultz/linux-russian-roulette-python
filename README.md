## Note from the author
I'm not responsible for your stupidity. **DO NOT** use this file, it **CAN** and **WILL** destroy your operating system with extreme prejudice.

If you truly want to see it at work, install a VM machine and run it there. Read the disclaimer.

# Here it is in action... sorta

This version simply deletes a file in ``/root/`` called ``derp``. You will need to select a more *permanent* directory to completely dirtnap the PC in question (ex: ``/etc``, ``/bin``, etc.)
